This is just a simple and non-consumer facing project to personally learn Spring Boot, develop confidence in JUnit, implementing SOLID and consistent programming principles, abiding by good testing practices and consistent standards.
Comments included are for personal future reference and for learning during implementation.

Primary resource of learning for this project is coming from Devtiro course on Spring Boot - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nv2DERaMx-4&t=16760s
